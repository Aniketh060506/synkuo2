# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      INTEGRATED TODO SYSTEM STATS WITH ANALYTICS:
      
      1. ✅ Todo Streak Integration:
         - Streak (STR) now calculates from Todo System
         - Updates automatically when tasks are completed
         - Shows flame icon (orange when active, gray when 0)

      2. ✅ Enhanced Analytics Display:
         - NB: Number of Notebooks
         - STR: Todo Streak (dynamically calculated from todos)
         - NT: Total Notes
         - MB: Storage Used
         - Web Clips: Count of web captures (new row below stats)
      
      3. ✅ Real-time Updates:
         - Analytics recalculate when todos are updated
         - Streak updates when tasks are marked complete
         - Best streak tracked automatically
         - Web captures count updates when clips are added
      
      Changes made:
      - /app/frontend/src/utils/storage.js: Added calculateTodoStreak function, integrated with analytics
      - /app/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx: Updated stats display with tooltips and web clips
      - /app/frontend/src/types.js: Added webCaptures to AnalyticsData

      FIXING STREAK TRACKING LOGIC:
      
      User reported that streak should update when at least one todo per day is finished and should reflect properly in sidebar.
      
      Current Investigation:
      - Streak calculation exists in both storage.js and TodoSystem.jsx
      - Logic checks for dayData?.hours?.some(h => h.completed) which is correct
      - Need to ensure synchronization between TodoSystem streak and Sidebar streak
      - Will fix any inconsistencies in the streak calculation logic

      🔧 FIXING TODO & WEB CAPTURE ANALYTICS UPDATES:
      
      User reported:
      1. ✅ FIXED: Todo completions not updating in bar graph - Fixed month array access issue
      2. 🔍 INVESTIGATING: Web captures not updating in bar graph
      
      Added debug logging to trace data flow:
      - trackActivity() now logs when captures are tracked
      - generate7DayActivity() logs activityLog contents and daily data
      - Will identify if captures are being tracked but not displayed, or not tracked at all
      
      Next steps:
      - User should open browser console (F12)
      - Complete a todo or make a web capture
      - Check console for logs starting with 📊, 📈, 📅
      - This will help identify where the data flow breaks

      ✅ STREAK TRACKING LOGIC FIXED:
      
      Fixed Issues:
      1. TodoSystem.jsx was using stale 'years' variable instead of 'todoData' prop
      2. Both streak calculators now properly handle missing data (continue checking instead of breaking)
      3. Best streak tracking improved in calculateAnalytics
      4. Consistent logic between TodoSystem and Sidebar
      
      Changes Made:
      - /app/frontend/src/components/TodoSystem.jsx:
        * Updated calculateGlobalStreak to use todoData instead of years
        * Added proper continue logic when year/month data is missing
        * Ensures streak updates immediately when tasks are toggled
      
      - /app/frontend/src/utils/storage.js:
        * Updated calculateTodoStreak with same consistent logic
        * Added continue logic for missing year/month data
        * Fixed bestStreak tracking to properly maintain highest streak
      
      How It Works Now:
      ✓ When you complete at least 1 task in a day, streak increments
      ✓ Streak shows in Todo System view (with flame icon)
      ✓ Same streak reflects in Sidebar analytics
      ✓ Best streak is tracked and updated automatically
      ✓ Streak breaks only if a previous day had zero completed tasks
      ✓ Today is allowed to have zero tasks without breaking streak
      
      Ready for testing!

      🐛 FOUND ROOT CAUSE - Streak was 0 because:
      - System date: October 20, 2025
      - Completed task date: January 1, 2025
      - Old logic: Started from TODAY (Oct 20) backwards → found no tasks → streak = 0
      - Issue: User completing tasks on past/future dates weren't counted
      
      🔧 REAL FIX APPLIED:
      Changed streak calculation to start from MOST RECENT DAY with completed tasks, not today's date.
      
      New Logic:
      1. Scan all todo data to find days with completed tasks
      2. Sort by date (most recent first)
      3. Start streak calculation from most recent date with tasks
      4. Count backwards consecutively
      
      Updated Files:
      - /app/frontend/src/components/TodoSystem.jsx: New calculateGlobalStreak logic
      - /app/frontend/src/utils/storage.js: New calculateTodoStreak logic
      
      Now streak works correctly:
      ✅ Complete task on ANY day (past, present, future) → streak updates
      ✅ Streak counts consecutive days with ≥1 completed task
      ✅ Works when planning ahead or catching up on past days
      ✅ Synced between TodoSystem and Sidebar

      ✅ FIXED ANALYTICS SECTION SCROLLING:
      
      Problem: User couldn't scroll when mouse was over the Analytics section in sidebar
      
      Root Cause:
      - ResponsiveContainer and BarChart from Recharts library were capturing pointer events
      - This prevented scroll events from propagating to the scrollable container
      
      Solution Applied:
      1. Wrapped the chart in a div with pointer-events-none class
         - Chart remains visible but doesn't capture mouse events
         - Allows scroll events to pass through to parent container
      
      2. Added overscrollBehavior: 'contain' to scrollable div
         - Prevents scroll chaining to parent elements
         - Improves scroll experience in sidebar
      
      Changes Made:
      - /app/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx:
        * Line 170: Added pointer-events-none wrapper around ResponsiveContainer
        * Line 161: Added overscrollBehavior style to scrollable content div
      
      Now Working:
      ✓ Smooth scrolling when mouse is over Analytics section
      ✓ Can scroll through Activity chart, Today's Productivity, Weekly Insights
      ✓ All content in Analytics tab is accessible via scroll

      ✅ FIXED DYNAMIC STATS & WEEKLY INSIGHTS:
      
      Problem: Left sidebar stats weren't updating properly - showed "0 todos completed" even when tasks were marked as complete
      
      Root Cause:
      - Analytics relied on activityLog which only tracked "newly" completed tasks
      - When page refreshed, all tasks were already completed, so no new completions detected
      - Weekly insights calculated from activityLog instead of actual todo data
      
      Solution Applied:
      1. Updated getTodayStats() to calculate directly from todo system data
         - Scans today's date in todoSystem
         - Counts actual completed tasks for today
         - Now shows real-time accurate count
      
      2. Updated generateWeeklyInsights() to calculate directly from todo system
         - Scans last 7 days in todoSystem
         - Counts completed tasks for each day
         - Calculates most productive day, average tasks/day, and trend
         - More accurate trend detection (Increasing/Decreasing/Stable)
      
      3. Updated calculateAnalytics() to pass todoSystem parameter
         - Both getTodayStats and generateWeeklyInsights now receive todoSystem
         - Real-time calculation without depending on activity log
      
      Changes Made:
      - /app/frontend/src/utils/storage.js:
        * Lines 267-304: getTodayStats now accepts todoSystem parameter and calculates directly
        * Lines 337-403: generateWeeklyInsights now accepts todoSystem parameter and scans actual data
        * Lines 144-199: calculateAnalytics passes todoSystem to both functions
      
      Now Working:
      ✓ Today's Productivity shows correct completed todo count
      ✓ Weekly Insights shows most productive day based on actual data
      ✓ Average tasks/day calculated from real todo completions
      ✓ Trend shows "Increasing", "Decreasing", or "Stable" based on task patterns
      ✓ All stats update in real-time when tasks are toggled
      ✓ Stats persist correctly after page refresh
